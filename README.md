# Simple calculator

## What is it?

### It is a simple calculator app.

It's capable of everything that a standard calculator can do, such as:

- addition
- subtraction
- multiplication
- division
- modulo / percent

It also has `undo` button so you can undo any unnecessary changes you have made.

**If you encounter any issues with it, let me know about them [here.](https://github.com/mejsiejdev/calculator/issues)**
